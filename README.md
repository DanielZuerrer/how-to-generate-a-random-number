# How to Create a Random Number

## [Click here for the actual website](https://danielzuerrer.github.io/how-to-generate-a-random-number/)

Have you ever needed to generate a random number in your programming language of choice? Do you forget how to do that every time so you have to google it again? For the 39th time? This project tries to give an overview of how to generate a random number in all languages (the list is quite small right now, but it is expandable).

## Two Types of Random Numbers

For all featured languages I show the code for two different intervals. The semi-open interval `[0,1[` for floating point numbers and the closed interval `[0,100]` for integers. You should be able to extrapolate for your needs, but these are the ones I usually need.

## Precision

I do try to have correct code samples on the page. However, there will obviously be mistakes and I'd love to hear about them. That being said: The goal is to have good enough code, not the perfect code. I don't care if a distribution is not 100% uniform. If it's good enough for actual use, it's good enough to be on my website.

### Adding Languages

I might be adding new languages from time to time. Missing your favorite? That's what pull requests are for!
